                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        I currently work full time at Target as a Starbucks Barista.
                        I graduated Magna Cum Laude from Valparaiso University in May 2021
                        with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering.
                        I have learned to code in C, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                        I am also familiar with MATLAB, Arduino, Git, and MySQL.
                        Outside of work, I love film and photography.
                        Music is my life and I love it in all forms. I mostly collect
                        records and cassette tapes.
                        I would love to be able to travel more and experience new things. 
                        With my current level of experience and education, I am looking for a position
                        as a Computer Programmer or Software Engineer. 
                        In a world forever changing by technology, I want to be part of that change
                        and help make people's lives easier.

                            In college, I worked a lot with networks and databases.
                            I mainly focused on MySQL databases and how to write
                            many different queries. Some examples are shown below.
                        </p>

                            In this activity, I was asked to correct the code so that I could be 
                            able to find semantic HTML elements, find accessible alt attributes, 
                            and find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of 
                            styling and positioning.
