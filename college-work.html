        <p class="intro">
            I attended Valparaiso University from 2017 to 2021.
            I started out with a major in Computer Engineering; however,
            I quickly realized I enjoyed not only hardware, but the software
            side of technology as well. After my first semester, I became a double
            major in Computer Science and Engineering. I studied a plethora of
            different topics, such as mobile computing, embedded microcontrollers,
            computer architecture, database management systems, and networks.

        <p class="c">
            One of the first programming languages was C. Learning the syntax
            was fairly easy. My earlier programs were fairly simple compared to
            what I could do at the end of the semester. One example is a program
            I designed that would be able to calculate the area of a triangle when
            the user input a width and height.

            Another example I have from later on in the course is my palindrome program.
            I designed a program that would detect whether or not the user's input was
            a palindrome.
